It's been literal years since I've last actually started a programming project and put some investment into it. I started this post on July 4th, of all days. After a month or two of actively playing the part of a [NEET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEET) as much as I could, I figured maybe I should actually get back into making things.

I've been meaning to try something from Austin Henley's [blog on projects](https://austinhenley.com/blog/challengingprojects.html) that all programmers should try (no clue how I even knew about this - maybe a Google search for project ideas?). I've also been wanting to get properly acquainted with Rust... as well as NeoVim. After all, these are tools that great programmer use, right? And of course, nothing would make me happy other than choosing the most difficult project from the list: a game emulator.

Needless to say, this was a lot at once. I can hardly call myself the most experienced or skilled developer, and I wanted to "catch up" so to speak to my friends who'd already been dabbling with this stuff for years now.
